# Project--ML-14

**In this project we will build the Model Random Forest Classifier for classifying Purchased as 0(Not Purchased) or 1(Purchased) from different features in the dataset**.<br></br>  

K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters.
Unsupervised Machine Learning is the process of teaching a computer to use unlabeled, unclassified data and enabling the algorithm to operate on that data without supervision.Without any previous data training, the machine’s job in this case is to organize unsorted data according to parallels, patterns, and variations.<br></br>

The goal of clustering is to divide the population or set of data points into a number of groups so that the data points within each group are more comparable to one another and different from the data points within the other groups. It is essentially a grouping of things based on how similar and different they are to one another. 


**Important- Note: Explore the dataset once before going through the code.**

**So what are you waiting for...? Jump to the code to get started. As usual for any doubt or query see you in pull request section 😁😂. Thanks!**
